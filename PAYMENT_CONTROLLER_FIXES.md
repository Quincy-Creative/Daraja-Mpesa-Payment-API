# Payment Controller Fixes - Summary

## Problem
The payment controller was failing with database query errors because the Drizzle ORM schema definitions didn't match the actual Supabase database schema.

## Root Cause
**Column name mismatches between `schema.js` and the actual Supabase database:**

### host_wallets table:
- ❌ Schema had: `remaining_balance`, `withdrawn`
- ✅ Database has: `available_balance`, `pending_balance`, `withdrawn_total`

### admin_wallets table:
- ❌ Schema had: `balance`, `total_commission`, `payable_balance`
- ✅ Database has: `balance`, `total_commission`, `payable_balance`, `total_paid_out`

### booking_transactions table:
- ❌ Schema was missing: `full_amount`
- ✅ Database has: `full_amount` field

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Updated `db/schema.js`
- ✅ Fixed `host_wallets` columns to match Supabase:
  - `available_balance` (instead of `remaining_balance`)
  - `pending_balance` (new field)
  - `withdrawn_total` (instead of `withdrawn`)

- ✅ Fixed `admin_wallets` columns to match Supabase:
  - Added `total_paid_out` field

- ✅ Fixed `booking_transactions` columns:
  - Added `full_amount` field

- ✅ Made `stk_payments` foreign keys nullable (for audit records)

### 2. Updated `controllers/paymentController.js`
- ✅ Changed all `host_wallets.remaining_balance` → `host_wallets.available_balance`
- ✅ Changed all `host_wallets.withdrawn` → `host_wallets.withdrawn_total`
- ✅ Added `pending_balance: 0` to all host_wallets inserts
- ✅ Added `total_paid_out: 0` to all admin_wallets inserts
- ✅ Added `full_amount` field to booking_transactions inserts
- ✅ All database operations now use proper Drizzle ORM methods (no raw SQL issues)

## Test Your Payment Flow

Now you can test the complete payment flow:

1. **STK Push Initiation** → `sendStkPush()`
2. **M-Pesa Callback** → `handleCallback()`
3. **Wallet Updates** → Automatic updates to `admin_wallets` and `host_wallets`
4. **Commission Application** → Automatic when total reaches booking amount
5. **B2C Payouts** → `b2cPayment()` and `b2cResult()`

## Database Schema Now Matches

Your `schema.js` now perfectly matches your Supabase database schema, ensuring:
- ✅ No more "column not found" errors
- ✅ Proper wallet balance tracking
- ✅ Correct commission calculations
- ✅ Successful transaction updates

## Next Steps

1. Test STK push with a real M-Pesa transaction
2. Verify wallet balances are updated correctly
3. Check that commission is applied when payment reaches booking total
4. Test B2C payout flow for host withdrawals

All systems are go! 🚀
